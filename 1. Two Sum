1. TWO SUM

            if diff in seen:                # Check if the difference is in the dictionary keys
                return [seen[diff], i]      # return the array 
            seen[v] = i                     # adds current index and value into the dictionary
        
                                            # dont need return as we assume each input has exactly one solution
